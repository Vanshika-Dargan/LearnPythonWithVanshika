Q. 2 point of views of a function?

generally the function created by one programmer is used by other
to achieve this both the function definition and function call are seperated

Python->Python36->Lib->save your code here

this can now be used directly in ide with import statement




Q. What happens when we create a function?

as soon as the python interpreter sees the def keyword
it creates a global frame for the function, which marks its existence globally
next it jumps to that part of the code where the function was called
it picks up the value of the argument to the function
and then creates a temporary block or local frame for the function
This frame stores info about the function local varialbes etc
It is where all the computataion happens
once the function is executed completely, the output is stored in the global frame
and the local frame of the function is destroyed

In a way we can say the global frame only have info about the final result and exists as long as the code exists
the local frame is where all the local variables are stored and computation is done, it is destroyed the moment interpreter exists the function.

Q. Difference between parameters and arguments

parmeter is what is written inside the function () when defining it
e.g. brigtness level of your phone is a parameter 

argument is the set of values passed to the function while calling it 
e.g. 0-10 brightness level values are arguments

Q. types of arguments in python
1. default arguments
2. positional arguments
3. keyword arguments
4. arbitary order arguments
5.variable-length positional arguments(*args)
6. variable-length keyword arguments(*args)
